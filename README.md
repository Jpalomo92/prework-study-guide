# prework-study-guide

## Description

This study guide was deployed to not only help me keep track of important notes, but to get familiar with the applications that developers use.
It was a challenging project, but the reason is because this is all very new to me. The more I was learning about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript language, the more I began to realize just how creative these languages allow me to be. I'm very excited to see how far my expertise in web development can go.

This project helped me get the basics set up and made me well aware of the things I should know before classes begin. For example, I had a lot of trouble understanding what the purpose of GitBash was. It wasn't until getting hands on experience by creating this study guide where I truly grasped the purpose. I also learned that debugging takes a great level of patience. 

At first I felt completely lost with the terminology, but now I feel more confident going into Bootcamp.
